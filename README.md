## Project Overview

Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Boston housing dataset, employing various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Key Highlights

- Conducted an initial overview of the dataset, focusing on key attributes such as crime rates, room counts, and property tax rates.
- Developed a robust function to handle missing values, ensuring data cleanliness and reliability.
- Analyzed relationships between attributes to identify potential influences on the target variable.
- Utilized statistical methods and visualizations (histograms, scatter matrices) for insights into attribute distributions and correlations.
- Implemented functions to visualize attribute histograms and scatter matrices for a comprehensive analysis.
- Computed Pearson's correlations between attributes, with a focus on factors like the number of rooms (RM), lower status percentage (LSTAT), and property age (AGE).
- Implemented a linear regression prediction model using the Scikit-Learn library.
- Created functions for model fitting and prediction based on selected attributes.
- Developed a prediction evaluation function, assessing model performance through metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
- Successfully developed and implemented a linear regression model for predicting Boston housing prices.
- Gained valuable insights into attribute correlations and their influences on median property values (MEDV).
- Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
